# Matrix Traversal

The attached code has the following complexity

Time complexity: **O(m*n)**

Space complexity: **O(1)** 

where m = number of rows, n = number of columns   

Unit tests are implemented using JUnit.

#### Alternative approaches:
##### Approach 1:
Code containing time complexity: **O(n)** and space complexity: **O(n)**
However there is a tradeoff between the time complexity and space complexity. Based on the business requirement we can choose the approach accordingly.

##### Approach 2:
We can also use recursion here which has the same time complexity **(O(m*n))** and space complexity **(O(1))** as the existing approach.
