# Matrix Traversal

The attached code has the following complexity

Time complexity: **O(m*n)**

Space complexity: **O(1)** 

where m = number of rows, n = number of columns   

Unit tests are implemented using JUnit.

#### Alternative approach:
We can also use recursion here which has the same time complexity **(O(m*n))** and space complexity **(O(1))** as the existing approach.
